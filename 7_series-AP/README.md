## Series Arithmetic Progression

In series AP , the sequence follows a constant difference between the neighbour items.

- i.e nth Item + difference = n+1 item
- n-1 item + differenece = nith item

- Initially minimum of 2 elements are given in order to find the pattern between the elements of the series.
- Series of AP Example:
  1. series: 1,3,5,7,9,11,13.
     The above series is following the n+1 the element is obtained by adding +2 to nth element.
     Observe diffence between the consecutive items is +2.

2.  series: 10,8,6,4,2,0.
    In this series the n+1th item of series is obtained by adding -2 to nth element.
    In this case difference between the consecutive items is -2.
